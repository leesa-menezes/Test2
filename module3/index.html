    <h6>Chicken</h6>
  <p>PDQ is part of a wave of gourmet chicken finger quick serve restaurants making their way across the U.S. Like Raising Canes, PDQ focuses on a core menu surrounding fried chicken strips. But PDQ flexes its creative muscle by not only selling the strips standalone but also by putting those strips into a variety of items.The heart of the PDQ menu is the chicken tender. The strip is thick and meaty, juicy with a crispy shell. Just the way a strip should be. In addition to fries they have delicious garlic broccoli, fried zucchini, and other more exotic sides.

    <h6>Beef</h6><p>What is it about ginger beef and onion stir fry that makes it so good? Is it the tender strips of beef, the sizable strips of onions, or the bite of fresh ginger? It could be any one of those things, but it’s most likely the combo of all three plus a savory sweet and tangy lemon soy sauce that makes this a weeknight winner. Make it in the amount of time it’d take to have delivery come to your door. What is it about ginger beef and onion stir fry that makes it so good?
